              <h1></h1>
              <h2 class="section-heading">Dr. Jesse Bemley</h2>

              <p>Dr. Bemley founded the Joint Education Facilities (JEF) Program, a non-

profit 501(c)(3) organization in 1982, with minimum equipment in a room

in the basement of his home in Washington DC. Using his Computer

Science expertise he conducted the program every Saturday, always with

little funding. From those humble beginnings, he has built a program with

a strong reputation for excellence in mentoring over 700 young people

throughout the DC area. He has accomplished much with the JEF

program. He has combined his many leadership skills with the courage

and willingness to accept challenges and hurdles associated with

mentoring inner-city youth. Not only has he been able to introduce these

students to the acquisition of computer skills, knowledge, and leading-

edge technology, but he has also been successful in expanding their

horizons as well. This expansion has frequently included learning to write

a technical article, or taking that very first plane ride. It has often been

the student's first opportunity to speak before the public, or the first time

to receive an achievement award at a banquet with all the parents and

friends looking on.</p>
              <p>Dr. Bemley takes pride in preparing his students for making presentations

within the local community as well as at conferences and professional

meetings. The young men and women are encouraged to participate in

student-initiated projects for which they learn to undertake research and

complete it in a timely fashion. As a project is in progress, the next step is

learning to present it before an audience. JEF prepares its students to

enter computer competitions such as: NAACP Afro-Academic, cultural,

Technological and Scientific Olympics (ACT-SO); Computer Learning

Foundation Contest; the Goucher College Programming Competition for

High School Students ; Computer Learning Foundation Contest; BDPA

National High School Computer Competition (HSCC) and Information

Technology (IT) Showcase; National Technical Association (NTA) Science

Competition for High School Students; the Association of

Computer/Information Sciences and Engineering Departments at

Minority Institutions (ADMI); TeraGrid Programming Competition and

Supercomputer Conference Education Committee Student Programming

Competition.</p>
              <p>For many of the students, Dr. Bemley represents a surrogate father. He

can convince any child over time to accept challenges and strive to do

well. All of the young people grow as a result of being trained and

coached by him for competition and participation in conferences,

nationally and internationally. He has been able to implement peer

counseling and teaching techniques that have improved the leadership

and team-building skills of his students. Parents and instructors

constantly notice considerable growth in self-esteem. Even when it

requires great sacrifice, he always rewards his students with an annual

banquet and a carefully selected keynote speaker, who can serve as a

role model to the assembled students and their parents, relatives, and

friends. This rewarding of progress, achievements, and skill acquisitions

works well in developing good citizenship.</p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">COMPUTERS/STEM FOR KIDS (GRADES 4-6)</h2>
              <p>This course is designed for kids in grades 4-6. Students are introduced to

computers (hardware and software), and the language C to learn algorithms and

to apply them in the development of simple programs in the areas of geometry,

basic electricity and Newtonian physics. Emphasis is placed on developing note

taking skills, listening skills and computational thinking skills. Students learn

group dynamics, develop a WEB page and prepare a short paper and an oral

presentation of their work. Central to this level is developing the skills above in

preparation for the research involved at the next level which requires rigorous

writing and analytical skills.</p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">COMPUTERS/STEM FOR KIDS (GRADES 7-12)</h2>

              <p>This course is aimed at students in grades 7-12 who have varying knowledge of

computers. Topics covered include: types of computers, definition of a computer,

components of computers, introduction to various operating systems, ie.,

Microsoft WINDOWS operating systems (XP, Vista and 7), and LINUX;

introduction to Internet tools, i.e., perl, Java, VRML, etc., HPC concepts (Cluster

and Grid computing) and an introduction to various math (continuous and

discrete) and science problems that can be solved using the PC and high

performance computing (HPC) platforms.</p>

            <p>Students do research projects in information systems, computer science,

computational science, and computer experiments in mathematics. Research

tools include the Internet, JEF library, National Science Digital Library, HPC

facilities at Clemson University and Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, and

university and public libraries. These projects will be entered in the NAACP ACT-

SO Competition, the NTA Conference, BDPA IT Showcase, JEF International

Student Symposium, Richard Tapia Conference, TeraGrid Conference, Super

Computer Conference and various other conferences, competitions and science

fairs to include 4H. The project results will be presented in an academic paper

format, Powerpoint presentation format and a poster display format.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Students at JEF learn how to program using a Raspberry Pi.</h2>
            <p>Students are introduced to the Raspberry Pi a computer that

is roughly the size of a credit card. Its circuit board and

chips are fully visible. You can plug a Raspberry Pi into a

digital TV or monitor, attach a USB keyboard and mouse,

making it very easy to use and because of its size you can

easily carry it anywhere.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Students at JEF</p>
            <ul>
             <li>Learn what a Raspberry Pi is</li>
             <li>Learn the components and how to setup a Raspberry Pi</li>
             <li>Lean how to install the operating system Rasbian; and how to properly boot their computers and open games.</li>
             <li>Learn to write, and debug simple programs usingPython and Scratch.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Joint Educational Facilities Inc. (JEF) students were introduced to cutting edge technology that has

catapulted them ahead of their peers and contemporaries.  Each student was required to do research,

prepare a paper and do a presentation. These activities were truly at the undergraduate and graduate level.

Mind you these students are high school Juniors and Seniors who would have preferred to spend their

summer “hanging out”.  These students rose to the occasion. Even though they had a busy schedule with JEF,

preparing papers and presentations for several conferences and attending other workshops, they proved

that they can perform at the collegiate level.</p>

            <p>I was impressed how the students worked ever so diligently to overcome the obstacles that they faced while

working on this project.  Most of the information that was taught to the students in the Cluster Workshop at

the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) was new to them. They took the initiative to

learn the different applications on their own.  They were very inquisitive asking thought provoking questions

to Mr. Michael White, who teaches Linux/Unix at the United States Department of Agriculture Graduate

School, and is considered an expert on Linux/Unix and Dr. Jesse Bemley, Director and founder of the JEF

program.  A couple of the students had the opportunity to travel to Daytona Beach, Florida to visit Bethune-

Cookman College, and to interview Mr. Alson Been on his progress with the cluster project and then to

Orlando, Florida to meet Mr. Amado Gonzalez to get information on his project at Florida International

University.  Both of these professors taught a segment at the NCSA workshop on cluster computing.</p>
            <p>This was an outstanding opportunity for the students for they are part of technology history!!!  The training

they received while doing this project will shape their future. These students will eventually see the fruition

of their labor and can actually say they were a part of this great project. They have proven to themselves and

the world that high school students can do research and should be given the opportunity to continue to

research projects of this nature.  The students will be a great asset to any college or university and will

definitely contribute to the scientific community.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">GIS Technology Program</h2>

            <p>This program uses GIS technology to solve problem in social

science.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Students will learn about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Environmental Racism</li>
              <li>History of Anacostia</li>
              <li>Changes of DC</li>
              <li>The development of the Metro System <br> <br>Each Student will learn to use GIS software, GPS

units, and cameras to collect and gather data. The

data will be organized into various categories to be

placed in a geospatial data base.</li>
            </ul>
