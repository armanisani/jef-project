                    <h3>Bryan Christopher Bemley</h3>

                    <p>is a 16 year-old senior that attends Archbishop Carroll High School. Bryan has been using computers since the age of 4 years. Since then, he has had a great fascination with computers and computing. In grades four through six, Bryan began learning the basic fundamentals of the programming language C. In the seventh grade he continued to learn C and also began learning HTML. Bryan has presented at numerous local, national, and international conferences with projects associated with the field of Computer Science. Some of these conferences include the National Technical Association (NTA), Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA), World Multi-Conference On Systemics Cybernetics, and Informatics (SCI), the District Of Columbia Computer Science Conference (DCCSC), and the International Joint Conference On Neural Networks. At these conferences, Bryan has presented papers on topics such as Artificial Life and Genetic Algorithms, Solving The Traveling Salesman Problem, Smart Toys, and Solving The Touch Sensor Problem Using Lego Mindstorms. Currently, Bryan is doing research on Robotics, web design, 3D art and animation, C and C++ programming and music production. Some of his future goals are to start a video game/multimedia company, start a record label, and develop computer applications that can better the use of computers for everyday life.</p>

                    <h3>Darren Lamison-White</h3>

                    <p>is a graduate of From The Heart Christian School and is very talented when it comes to public speaking, and also has a plethora of academic achievements.Currently he is a freshman computer science major at Bowie State University. He is currently working on a project that involves a version of DOS that has the ability to multitask. This goal of the project is to be able to use this as an operating system so that two external signals can be processed using different applications. The external signals are actually the vibrations that are being detected from both a horizontal and vertical displacement seismometers. This project has already won Darren a first place gold metal in the regional ACT-SO competition, and he will be participating in the national competition in Philadelphia in July. Darren has also entered this project into the District of Columbia Computer Science Competition (DCCSC) at American University back in April 2004. Also, this project won second place at the From The Heart Christian School's high school 2004 science fair in January. After that it advanced to the Prince Georges County regional science fair, where it received honorable mention. Darren was also a flutist in his High School's orchestra. In both 2003 and 2004 the orchestra played an annual concert at the From the Heart Church of Philadelphia. In the yea 2002 it won the first place trophy, at the Orchestra Competition in Williamsburg, Virginia. In the summer of the year 2003, Darren took a number of classes at United States Department of Agriculture Graduate School (USDA-GS). The courses that I took were the following: Network + Certification, PC Troubleshooting, MS-Word, and programming in Basic. Darren also participated in the Prince Georges County Science Fair in the year 2002. The project that he entered, involved him processing sound waves through the output of a circuit board of an overdrive pedal. This project won second place at his High School, and an Honorable Mention at the Prince Georges County Science Fair. In the year 2000, Darren won first place at his High School and County Science Fair, with a project in which he built a horizontal displacement seismometer that allowed him to actually detect earthquakes worldwide. After High School, Darren will be participating in a Summer College program at Bowie State University, which will allow him to earn six credit hours, and a potential scholarship for $12,000. In the fall Darren will be attending Bowie State University majoring in Computer Science.</p>

It now functions as a desktop computer and it is capable of running Linux. In the 2004 Eric Lamison-White presented the Xbox Linux project at the Prince George’s County Regional Science Fair, the District of Columbia Computer Science Conference (DCCSC 2004) , the NAACP ACT-SO Scientific Cultural Fair, the JEF International Student Symposium (where he received 2nd Place in high school paper competition) and in the MIE Conference at Bowie State University. With this project he won a $12,000 renewable scholarship to Bowie State University. The United States Army and the George Washington University School of Applied Sciences along with the Patent and Trademark Office Society also recognized him. In the 2003 Eric spoke at the following conferences about his research in video editing: DCCSC 2003, The 7th World Multi-Conference on Systematics, Cybernetics and Informatics (SCI 2003), Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA 2003), National Technical Association (NTA 2003), Louis Stokes – Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP 2003). He speaks some Japanese and exercised his Japanese language skills at the SCI 2003 international conference. He feels that the Japanese language will be of value in furthering his career. Over the past few years he has been maintaining the website www.serebi-nation.org and has used different programming languages and scripts on it. It is written in HTML, using CSS and JavaScript. Recently added is a forum running in PHP and MySQL. In 2002 he wrote a program that calculated planetary orbits in Visual Basic. It won him Grand Prize at the Regional County Science Fair. Had he been older he would have gone to the Intel Nationals. After High School he does plan to attend college. Though, he is not decided upon a particular major, he plans to be in the film industry working in the field of video editing.</p>

                    <p>is a graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School. His research areas were Neural Networks and web design.His research was presented at the NTA conferences in Washington, DC and Hampton, VA, the ADMI Symposium in Duluth, MN and the Fourth World Multi-Conference in Orlando.</p>

                    <h3>William Youmans, III</h3>

                    <p>a graduate of the Dunbar High School Pre-Engineering Program and Florida A&M University, received a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida. Williams is employed by Loockheed Martin as a senior systems integrator. Youmans is a graduate of the JEF AI program where he and Duane Doles were the principal architects of the last version of TEENBAS, an AI model of a Black Teenager written in the AI language Prolog. As  high school seniors he and Doles appeared on Black Entertainment Television's TEEN SUMMIT and on the front cover of I-PLUS magazine. His work over the summers of 1990-92 included a position at IBM in computer operations, a research assistant in the National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for Undergraduates at the American University, and expert system development and network security at the Mitre Corporation. In addition to his university studies, he outlined a project to interface all the JEF AI models into a Distributed AI system, where the various models could pass information between them.</p>

                    <h3>Brandon Young </h3>

                    <p>is a graduate of Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, MD. His research area was robot simulation. Brandon's robot simulator prototype was written in Prolog, an artificial intelligence language.  The program demonstrated how a robot moves through a two-dimensional world. It showed what happens when a robot bumps into something, based  on size, shape and other characteristics of both the robot and the offending object. Brandon was profiled in the In Depth section of the  May 8, 1995 issue of Computer World entitled Whiz Kids. His research  was presented at various local meetings and his first national conference was the SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science in Philadelphia.  </p>
